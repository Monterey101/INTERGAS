              LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)
            </h2>
            <h3 className="card-title">Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled to
              approximately –162°C, transforming it into a liquid form that
              occupies about one six-hundredth of its original volume. This
              process makes it far more efficient to transport over long
              distances, especially to regions without pipeline infrastructure.
              Primarily composed of methane, LNG is considered one of the
              cleanest fossil fuels, producing significantly less carbon dioxide
              and sulfur emissions when burned. Because of its environmental and
              logistical advantages, LNG plays a critical role in global energy
              transition efforts and serves as a bridge between traditional
              hydrocarbons and renewables.

            <h3 className="card-title">Supply Chain</h3>
            <p>
              The LNG supply chain is among the most technically complex in the
              energy sector. It begins with the extraction of natural gas from
              onshore and offshore fields, followed by processing to remove
              impurities such as water, CO₂, and heavier hydrocarbons. The
              purified gas is then cooled in liquefaction plants, loaded into
              cryogenic tankers, and shipped across the world. At the
              destination, LNG is regasified in import terminals before being
              distributed via pipeline networks to power stations, industrial
              users, and urban distribution grids. This end-to-end system
              requires careful synchronization between upstream production,
              midstream transport, and downstream consumption.

            <h3 className="card-title">Market Dynamics</h3>
            <p>
              The movement and pricing of LNG are shaped by global supply-demand
              dynamics, freight costs, and regional infrastructure constraints.
              Contracts range from long-term supply agreements to spot-market
              transactions, requiring expertise in logistics, credit management,
              and risk mitigation. Companies like INTERGAS participate in this
              ecosystem by helping to coordinate cargo movements and match
              buyers with suppliers across the Asia-Pacific region, ensuring
              commercial balance, reliability, and transparent market engagement
              without direct involvement in production or shipping operations.

              LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)
            </h2>
            <h3 className="card-title">Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) refers primarily to propane and
              butane gases obtained during crude oil refining and natural gas
              processing. It is stored under moderate pressure as a liquid and
              reverts to gas when released, making it easy to transport, store,
              and use across diverse applications. LPG burns cleanly and
              efficiently, offering high energy output relative to its volume.
              It is widely used for domestic heating and cooking, industrial
              processing, agriculture, and as a feedstock for petrochemical
              production. Its versatility has made it an indispensable part of
              modern energy systems, especially in regions where pipeline gas is
              limited or unavailable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3 className="card-title">Supply Chain</h3>
            <p>
              The LPG supply chain begins with extraction or refining, where
              heavier hydrocarbons are separated from raw natural gas or crude
              oil streams. The resulting propane and butane are then blended,
              stored in pressurized tanks, and shipped via pipelines, marine
              vessels, or road tankers. Distribution networks extend from bulk
              import terminals to local filling stations or cylinder depots,
              enabling access for both large industrial consumers and
              small-scale users. Efficient logistics and safety management are
              essential given LPG’s flammable nature, with strict standards
              applied to storage, handling, and transport throughout the chain.
            </p>

            <h3 className="card-title">Market Dynamics</h3>
            <p>
              Market access and timing play key roles in LPG trading, as
              seasonal demand patterns — particularly for heating and
              agricultural use — can cause significant price volatility. Traders
              help balance these fluctuations by optimizing storage and shipping
              schedules while ensuring reliable product quality. INTERGAS
              operates within this midstream environment, leveraging regional
              partnerships to connect refiners and importers while facilitating
              dependable supply routes across the Asia-Pacific. Its involvement
              helps streamline the flow of LPG from production hubs to consumer
              markets, emphasizing transparency, efficiency, and long-term
              relationship building.

              Crude Oil
            </h2>
            <h3 className="card-title">Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Crude oil is a naturally occurring liquid mixture of hydrocarbons
              formed over millions of years from decomposed organic matter.
              Extracted from underground reservoirs through drilling, it remains
              the world’s most critical energy resource and the backbone of
              modern industrial civilization. Once refined, crude oil produces
              transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, as
              well as numerous byproducts including lubricants, asphalt, and
              petrochemical feedstocks used to manufacture plastics and
              synthetic materials. Its ubiquity makes it central not only to the
              energy economy but also to virtually every manufacturing and
              transport sector globally.

            <h3 className="card-title">Supply Chain</h3>
            <p>
              The crude oil supply chain is vast and interconnected, beginning
              with exploration and production, often managed by national oil
              companies and major producers. Extracted crude is transported via
              pipelines, rail, or marine tankers to refineries, where it is
              separated and processed into a range of petroleum products through
              distillation and chemical refining. From there, the products move
              into wholesale and retail distribution networks serving
              industries, utilities, and consumers. Crude oil pricing and trade
              are governed by international benchmarks such as Brent and West
              Texas Intermediate, which reflect regional qualities, freight
              costs, and global market sentiment.

            <h3 className="card-title">Market Dynamics</h3>
            <p>
              In this complex global web, intermediaries and trading companies
              serve as vital connectors between producers, refiners, and end
              markets, facilitating flexible flows of supply in response to
              shifting demand. These firms provide market access, logistical
              coordination, and financial structuring to optimize deliveries and
              manage risk. INTERGAS contributes within this framework by
              engaging in responsible, transparent crude oil trading across the
              Asia-Pacific, aligning supply contracts with refiners and
              distributors while supporting regional energy security and market
              efficiency.
