            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              INTERGAS Pty Ltd (“INTERGAS”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) values and
              respects the privacy of every individual who visits our website or

              information you provide through our website’s contact form, as
              well as through any associated digital or offline communications.
              By submitting your details, you consent to the handling of your

            </p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
              When you complete the contact form on our website, we collect the
              following information: your full name, company name, industry,
              email address, phone number, and any message or inquiry you
              provide. This information allows us to respond effectively to your
              query, assess the nature of your business interest, and maintain
              appropriate communication for business or service-related
              purposes.
            </p>

              In addition to this direct information, our website may collect
              non-personally identifiable information such as browser type,
              operating system, referral source, time spent on pages, and IP
              address. This technical data is used exclusively to enhance the
              functionality, performance, and security of our website
              environment.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Use of Collected Information</h2>
            <p>
              The information you provide is used primarily for communication,
              verification, and customer engagement purposes. INTERGAS may use
              this data to respond to inquiries, deliver requested information
              about our products or services, evaluate partnership
              opportunities, and maintain accurate business records. We may also
              use the data to enhance user experience, improve our communication
              standards, and ensure compliance with applicable industry and
              regulatory requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              INTERGAS does not sell, rent, or exchange personal data for
              marketing or commercial gain. Any disclosure of data is limited
              strictly to operational, legal, or regulatory purposes, and only
              to authorized personnel or trusted third-party partners operating
              under confidentiality agreements.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
            <p>
              INTERGAS implements rigorous administrative, physical, and
              technical safeguards designed to protect your personal information
              against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
              destruction. While we employ secure servers and encryption
              standards appropriate to our operational scale, no method of
              transmission or storage can be guaranteed as entirely secure.
              Nevertheless, INTERGAS exercises due diligence and applies
              best-practice security measures across its digital systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Information collected via our website may be stored for as long as
              necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or as
              required by applicable law, contractual obligations, or internal
              policy. Upon expiration of such need, data may be securely
              archived or permanently deleted.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
            <p>
              INTERGAS may disclose your information to affiliated entities,
              service providers, and legal or regulatory authorities when
              reasonably necessary for legitimate business functions. Examples
              include IT infrastructure providers, website maintenance teams, or
              advisors bound by confidentiality obligations. INTERGAS does not
              disclose personal information to unrelated third parties except
              where legally required or explicitly authorized by you.
            </p>

            <h2>6. International Data Handling</h2>
            <p>

              and in accordance with our internal governance standards to ensure
              continued protection and lawful use of your information.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
