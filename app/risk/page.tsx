            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              INTERGAS Pty Ltd (“INTERGAS”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) provides this
              Risk Disclosure Statement to inform all clients, prospective
              clients, partners, and website users (“you” or “your”) of the
              inherent risks associated with engaging in energy trading, market
              analysis, and related commercial activities facilitated or
              referenced by INTERGAS. This statement is intended to provide a
              comprehensive understanding of potential risks, uncertainties, and
              operational considerations associated with participation in energy
              markets, including but not limited to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG),
              Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), crude oil, and other hydrocarbon
              commodities. By interacting with our website, submitting
              inquiries, or engaging in business discussions, you acknowledge
              that you have read, understood, and accepted the terms of this
              disclosure.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Market Risk</h2>
            <p>
              Energy markets are inherently volatile and are subject to
              fluctuations caused by geopolitical events, regulatory changes,
              macroeconomic conditions, supply-demand imbalances, currency
              fluctuations, transportation constraints, and unforeseen
              operational disruptions. Prices of LNG, LPG, crude oil, and other
              commodities may change rapidly, materially impacting the value of
              contracts, shipments, or transactions. INTERGAS does not guarantee
              any particular outcome with respect to market prices,
              availability, or profitability, and all participants must
              recognize that prior performance or historical trends are not
              indicative of future results.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Operational and Logistical Risk</h2>
            <p>
              The transportation, storage, and handling of energy commodities
              involve complex logistics and operational processes.
              Interruptions, delays, equipment failure, natural disasters, or
              port and terminal closures may affect delivery timelines and
              operational continuity. While INTERGAS may assist in coordinating
              logistics or connecting buyers and sellers, we do not assume
              liability for operational failures, shipment disruptions, or
              losses arising from third-party transport providers, storage
              facilities, or infrastructure limitations.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Regulatory and Compliance Risk</h2>
            <p>
              The energy sector is heavily regulated, with laws and standards
              varying across jurisdictions. Changes in taxation, import/export
              regulations, environmental obligations, trade sanctions,
              licensing, or compliance requirements can materially affect
              transactions and market operations. INTERGAS operates in
              accordance with applicable domestic and international regulations,
              including Australian legislation and industry standards, but does
              not guarantee that future regulatory changes will not impact
              market conditions or contractual obligations.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Financial Risk</h2>
            <p>
              All transactions in energy commodities carry financial risk,
              including potential exposure to credit risk, counterparty default,
              and liquidity constraints. INTERGAS does not provide financial
              guarantees, investment advice, or assurance of profit.
              Participants must conduct their own due diligence, seek
              independent financial and legal advice where necessary, and assess
              the suitability of engaging in transactions based on their own
              risk tolerance, financial capacity, and operational objectives.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Environmental and Force Majeure Risk</h2>
            <p>
              Natural events, including but not limited to storms, floods,
              earthquakes, hurricanes, or other force majeure occurrences, may
              disrupt production, transportation, or supply of energy
              commodities. Environmental compliance obligations may impose
              additional operational constraints or liabilities. INTERGAS
              endeavors to facilitate informed decision-making and communication
              between market participants; however, we cannot assume
              responsibility for losses arising from acts of God, extreme
              weather, or other uncontrollable circumstances.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Legal Risk</h2>
            <p>
              Participants in energy markets may encounter legal and contractual
              risks, including disputes arising from interpretation of
              contracts, jurisdictional conflicts, or third-party claims. While
              INTERGAS provides general guidance and intermediary services, all
              parties are expected to retain qualified legal counsel to evaluate
              contractual terms and obligations. INTERGAS does not accept
              liability for legal outcomes, contractual disagreements, or claims
              arising from participation in energy trading or related commercial
              arrangements.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Technology and Cybersecurity Risk</h2>
            <p>
              Digital communication, data transmission, and online trading
              platforms are subject to cybersecurity threats, system failures,
              or technical errors. While INTERGAS implements industry-standard
              security measures and maintains secure systems, we cannot
              guarantee absolute protection against unauthorized access,
              malware, or other cyber risks. Participants are responsible for
              safeguarding their own devices, accounts, and confidential
              information and should follow best practices for secure digital
              communication.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Acknowledgment and Responsibility</h2>

              market activity. It is the responsibility of each participant to
              make independent assessments, implement risk management measures,
              and seek professional advice as required.
            </p>
